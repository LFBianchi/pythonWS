    "    The approach I've taken to implement the bechdel test (or .isBechdel()) is simple: we create an iterator on the blines list and evaluate each item, if the item indicates a screen transition we fastfoward to the next female line in the script. If that female line is followed by a screen transition we fastfoward to the next female line until we get at least two named female characters with lines in a single scene, we are guarded from repetition by storing the females in scene in a set. There are mixed rules about the presence of male characters in the scenes, so if we find a male character in the middle of a scene we just ignore it.<br/>\n",
